If you wish to propose changes or contribute, please open an Issue labeled "mirror" or "aip-proposal" explaining the proposed contribution. Do NOT open pull requests until explicit permission is granted. Repository administrators may enable collaborative workflows and merge contributions at their discretion.

Note: A license file communicates legal terms but does not by itself prevent changes from being made on GitHub. To enforce a view-only workflow, restrict repository write permissions, enable branch protection rules on the main branch, and limit who can merge pull requests. I can help apply branch protection rules or create contributor guidelines if you would like.
